Source in your .bashrc, .zshrc, etc.  Then:

Open up `notar.sh` and set up `notesdir` to point to your Notes directory.
I like to keep mine in a Dropboxed folder.

* `nnote`: create a timestamped folder inside your notes folder and open
your text editor there.

your text editor on the file `note_name.md`.
